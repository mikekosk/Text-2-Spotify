      About
    </h1>

    <p>
      'Text 2 Spotify' was built in Jun 2018 as a learning experience in integrating multiple
      different APIs to build a functional Rails app. The source code for the
      application can be found <a href="https://github.com/mikekosk/Text-2-Spotify">here</a>.

      This app relies on guilhermesad's wonderful
      <a href "https://github.com/guilhermesad/rspotify">Spotify API Wrapper for Rails</a>
      and Twilio's Ruby API to serve incoming and outgoing messages.
